            <p>
              After completing my graduation in Commerce with Computer Applications,
              I enrolled in an industry-focused, intensive web development program at
              NxtWave. The program emphasized hands-on learning and practical exposure
              to full-stack web development using modern technologies.
            </p>

            <p>
              During this period, I built multiple real-world projects and gained
              experience working with HTML, CSS, JavaScript, React, Node.js, Express,
              and databases. I focused on writing clean code, implementing reusable
              components, and following best practices used in production-level
              applications.
            </p>

            <p>
              Alongside my learning, I worked as a Teaching Assistant, where I supported
              learners by resolving technical doubts, reviewing code, and guiding them
              through project development. This role strengthened my problem-solving,
              communication, and remote collaboration skills.
